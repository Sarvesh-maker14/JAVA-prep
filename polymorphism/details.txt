types of polymorphism 
1.compile time / static polymorphism --> achived via method overloading

method overloading --> same name of method --> types , arguments , return types , ordering can 
be different. 
A a = new A();
A a2 = new A(3,4);

compile time polymorphism --> java decide karega which constructor to call during compiling


2.run time polymorphism / dynamic polymorphism --> achived via method overriding

public class Shapes {
    void area(){
        
    }
}

public class Square extends Shapes {
        @override --> annotation --> to check whether the method is overriden or not
        void area(){
            this will run when the object of square is created hence it
            is overriding the parent method
        } 
}


--------------Upcasting---------------------------------------
Parent obj = new Child();
here which method will be called depends on the child 

Dynamic method dispatch --> call to a overriden method is called at run time




final --> cannot override a method which is final
